      When embarking on a linear fluorescent to LED retrofit job it is necessary to decide what type of LED tube to use, Type A, Type B, or Type C. Below is a table outlining the benefits and drawbacks of each type.
      <div className='pre-installation-table'>
      |        | Type A                                                             | Type B                                       | Type C                    |
      |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
      |        | LED tube with integrated driver wired to existing fluorescent ballast | LED tube with integrated driver wired to mains power | LED tube with external driver |
      | **Benefits**   | - Lowest installation labor cost<br/>- No rewiring required       | - High efficiency<br/>- High reliability and longevity<br/>- No ballast compatibility issues or ballast failure issues<br/>- Simplicity | - High efficiency<br/>- High reliability and longevity<br/>- No ballast compatibility issues or ballast failure issues<br/>- Excellent dimming<br/>- Low voltage outputs to lamp and switch |
      | **Drawbacks**  | - Reliability and longevity depend on the ballast<br/>- Possible compatibility issues with LED tube and existing ballast<br/>- Lowest efficiency of all three options<br/>- Limited dimming capabilities |  - High installation labor cost<br/>- Rewiring required<br/>- LED tube and dimmer compatibility<br/>- Most susceptible to flicker, careful selection needed | - High installation labor cost<br/>- Rewiring required<br/>- LED driver and LED lamp compatibility across brands |
      </div>

      Consider evaluating the age of the fixtures’ ballast and taking that information into consideration when choosing what type of LED to retrofit with. Magnetic ballasts are generally not compatible with LED tubes, even Type A LED tubes.

      For Type B LED tubes evaluate the LED tube and dimmer compatibility, especially if the building’s existing dimmer will remain in use.

      For Type C LED tubes evaluate the rewiring feasibility if dimmers are to be used.

      Consider visually evaluating the condition of and testing the two tombstone contacts with a voltmeter to determine whether a closed or open circuit exists. A closed circuit will indicate shunted tombstones. This information could influence which make and model LED tube to purchase for the project.

      Consider presenting all three options to the customer and discussing the advantages and drawbacks of each option.

    # Linear Fluorescent to LED Retrofit
    ## Photo Report

    <ProjectInfoReport {...props} />

    ## About the Report

    This report is intended to document the linear fluorescent to LED retrofit work.

    For the client/customer, this report contains information about the type of LED used
    in this project as well as photos showing the make and model number the LED tubes installed.
    This information is useful for when the time comes to purchase replacement LED tubes.
    There are three ways to retrofit a fixture to LED, Type A, Type B, and Type C.
    Some replacement LED tubes are compatible with only Type A, others are only compatible with
    Type B, while some replacement LED tubes are compatible with both Type A and B fixtures.
    Type C LED tubes are never compatible with Type A or B fixtures.

    For contractors that select different types of LED to retrofit depending on the project conditions, retaining a copy of this photo report could be useful for tracking long term reliability.

    For energy efficiency program managers and implementers, this photo report could be useful for helping contractors or client/customers diagnose the cause of performance problems. They are frequently caused by compatibility issues between an existing ballast and a particular Type A LED tube, or a particular dimmer and a particular Type B LED tube, or a particular LED driver and a particular Type C LED tube.

<Photo id="fixture_ballast_photo" label="Fixture Ballast – Photo" required>
    This information about the ballast is useful for when it comes time to
    purchase replacement LED lamps. If a different make and model LED tube is
    installed test for compatibility issues.

      Photo of the make and model of the dimmer. Note, when replacing the LED lamp
      or the dimmer in the distant future, some LED lamps and dimmers have compatibility
      issues that could be in the form of light flickering and/or buzzing sounds.
      Either purchase the same model equipment or purchase a small quantity of the new LED lamp and
      test for compatibility issues before making a larger order.

    Take note of this photo when it comes time to purchase replacement LED
    lamps. Some direct drive LED lamps are designed to be powered from a single
    end e.g. powered from a single non-shunted tombstone contact, while others
    are designed to go into fixtures that power a LED lamp from both ends.
