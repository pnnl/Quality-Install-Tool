    This workflow is for the window replacement method where block windows are used. 
    If the original window has wood frames, typically this method involves removing the sashes, 
    the interior and parting stop, and weights leaving the window frame and outer stop. 
    A block window without nail fins is installed into the window frame and aligned/sealed 
    to the outer stop. If the original frame window is made of metal or vinyl, typically 
    this method involves cutting the original window out using a reciprocating or oscillating saw, 
    leaving the nail fin in place. A block window without nail fins is installed into the 
    rough opening and the window is caulked to the siding.
