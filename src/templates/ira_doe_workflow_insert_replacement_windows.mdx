    This workflow is for the window replacement method where block windows are used.
    If the original window has wood frames, typically this method involves removing the sashes,
    the interior and parting stop, and weights leaving the window frame and outer stop.
    A block window without nail fins is installed into the window frame and aligned/sealed
    to the outer stop. If the original frame window is made of metal or vinyl, typically
    this method involves cutting the original window out using a reciprocating or oscillating saw,
    leaving the nail fin in place. A block window without nail fins is installed into the
    rough opening and the window is caulked to the siding.

    ## About the Report

    The photos in this report are intended to document the critical details of upgrading to a insert replacement windows installation.

    ## Before Removal of Old Window
    <Photo id="outside_photo" label="Outside – Photo" required>
      This is a representative photo of the condition of the original window viewed from the outside.
      - Look for signs of water damage, dry rot, or pest damage.
    </Photo>

    <Photo id="inside_photo" label="Inside – Photo" required>
      This is a representative photo of the condition of the original window viewed from the inside.
      - Look for signs of mold or water damage.
    </Photo>

    ## Immediately After Removing the Window Components
    <Photo id="after_removing_sill_area_photo" label="Sill Area – Photo" required>
      This is a representative photo of the condition of the sill area of the rough
      opening or window frame after the window components have been removed.
      - Look for signs of water damage, dry rot, or pest damage.
    </Photo>

    <Photo id="after_removing_head_area_photo" label="Head Area – Photo" required>
      This is a representative photo of the condition of the head section of the rough
      opening or window frame after the window components have been removed.
      - Look for signs of water damage, dry rot, or pest damage.
    </Photo>

    ## Rough Opening Flashing
     <Photo id="rough_opening_sill_area_photo" label="Sill Area – Photo" required>
        This is a representative photo of the sill section of the rough opening or
        window frame after it has been flashed.
        - Typically, liquid flashing, stretch tape, or plastic or metal pan flashing are used.
    </Photo>

    <Photo id="rough_opening_head_area_photo" label="Head Area – Photo" required>
        This is a representative photo of the head section of the rough opening or
        window frame after it has been flashed.

    ## After Installing the Window
    <Photo id="after_installing_outside_sill_area_photo" label="Outside Sill Area – Photo" required>
      This is a representative photo of the sill section from the outside after the new window has been installed.
      - For windows that have been cut out, leaving just the the nail fin, typically the new window is caulked to
      the siding material. Therefore, the quality of the caulk application is critical. Look for caulking with no gaps.
      - For installations where the original window frame remains, typically, the new block window is caulked to
      the old window frame. Thus the sill, head, and jambs are caulked. Look for caulking that has no gaps and
      is aesthetically pleasing.
