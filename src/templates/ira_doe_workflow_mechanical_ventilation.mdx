    ## Amount of Mechanical Ventilation Needed
    <Collapsible header="Mechanical Ventilation Calculation">
    * Consider using RED Calc ASHRAE 62.2 tools to do the mechanical ventilation calculation. https://basc.pnnl.gov/redcalc
      *	Consider infiltration credits. A very leaky home may still be leaky enough after the scoped air sealing and insulation work is completed.
    *	The ASHRAE 62.2 standard does not require the installation of a system smaller than 15 CFM (7 L/s)
    * If the ASHRAE 62.2 mechanical ventilation calculator finds that the home should have a whole-house mechanical ventilation system installed, please use this workflow to document.

    ## Existing Condition
    <Collapsible header="Existing Condition Details">
    The existing conditions of the home must be evaluated prior to installing mechanical ventilation. This includes evaluating:
        1.	Unavoidable point sources of indoor air pollution (e.g. showers, cooktop)
        2.	Avoidable point sources of indoor air pollution (e.g. back drafting combustion appliances)
        3.	Natural non-point sources of indoor air pollution (e.g. envelope air leakages)
        4.	Occupant caused non-point sources of indoor air pollution (e.g. smoking, pets, air fresheners, incense)
        5.	Outdoor air pollution levels (e.g. proximity to a busy street, neighbor’s smoking, wildfire smoke).

    The type of mechanical ventilation equipment and strategy should:
        1.	Capture unavoidable point sources of indoor air pollution near the source of emission, e.g. a exhaust fan should be in each full bath, and a range hood that exhaust to outdoors installed over the cooktop.
        2.	Not cause naturally drafting appliances to backdraft even under worse case conditions. See the Combustion Appliance Safety section in the Post-Installation tab for recording the combustion safety test results. Combustion appliance safety testing is only required if the home has one or more natural draft combustion appliances post-retrofit.
        3.	Effort to air seal the envelope to minimize natural non-point sources of indoor air pollution coming from an attached garage, unconditioned crawlspace, unconditioned attic, dusty walls.
        4.	Take into consideration ASHRAE 62.2 calculation as well as occupant caused non-point sources of indoor air pollution.
        5.	Take the level of chronic and intermittent outdoor air pollution levels into account.
