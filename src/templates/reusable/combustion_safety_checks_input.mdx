    ## Combustion Appliance Safety Testing

    If the home upgrades will result in a barometric draft controlled or Category I appliance equipped with a draft
    hood or connected to a natural draft venting system remaining in the conditioned envelope of the home, combustion
    safety checks are required to be performed at the completion of the project.
