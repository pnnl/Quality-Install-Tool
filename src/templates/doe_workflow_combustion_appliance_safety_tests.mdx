            If the home upgrades will result in a barometric draft
            controlled or Category I appliances equipped with a draft hood
            or connected to a natural draft venting system remaining in the
            conditioned envelope of the home, combustion safety checks are
            required to be performed at the completion of the project.
            
            If the tests fail, a combustion air opening connecting the
            combustion appliance area to the outdoors may need to be added
            or some other remediation may be required. The combustion safety
