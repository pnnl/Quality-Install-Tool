    ## HPWH Space Evaluation
    Consider using the <a href="https://basc.pnnl.gov/hpwh_installation_tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heat Pump Water Heater Selection Tool</a> to help choose the optimal HPWH for the home.
    <Collapsible header="HPWH Space Evaluation — Instructions">
      The successful installation of a heat pump water heater (HPWH) begins in the planning
      stage by assessing whether the location where the HPWH will be installed is suitable.
      The space around the HPWH must be:
      1. Large enough to meet the minimum HPWH air volume requirement of 700 ft<sup>3</sup>
      2. Where some compressor and fan noise (50 to 65 dB, normal conversation loudness) is
      acceptable
      3. Where the cooled air exhausted from the HPWH (approximately a half-ton) is acceptable or desirable
      4. More than 8 ft line-of-sight from a thermostat to prevent the cool air from affecting the thermostat
      5. Not dusty, or where a significant amount of dust is generated
      6. Tall enough (~12" taller than the tank height, ~76" if &lt; 65 gals to ~86" if &ge; 80
      gals) to allow the filter in the HPWH to be periodically accessed for cleaning
      7. Where there is access to a drain, drain line, or utility sink for condensate
      8. In the 40°F–125°F (4.4°C–51°C) temperature range year-round

      It is possible to also meet the air volume requirement of the HPWH by installing it next
      to a louvered door, or ducting the supply, exhaust, or both the supply and the exhaust
      of the HPWH to an adjacent space. It is also possible to install a condensate pump where
      a drain located below the elevation of the HPWH&apos;s condensate outlet is not available.

      You may find the following Space Air Volume Calculator useful in determining the volume to be
      entered in the &ldquo;Space Air Volume&rdquo; input below.

    <Collapsible header="HPWH & Building Science">
      Be mindful about the effects of pressurizing or depressurizing a zone from supply only
      ducting or exhaust only ducting a HPWH. Pressurizing or depressurizing a zone could result
      in pulling air containing moisture into walls or rim/band joists where the air reaches
      dew point and condenses to cause water damage or mold problems. Depressurizing a zone
      could also cause a naturally drafted combustion appliance in the same zone to fail to
      draft properly.

      Also be mindful about the humidity levels of the space the HPWH is located in. For example,
      if the exhaust air stream is directed against a wall or window on a hot and humid day,
      the cool air could possibly lower the temperature of the surface to the point of dew point
      and cause moisture damage.

    ## HPWH Installation

    <DateInput label="Installation Date" path="install_date" />

    <Collapsible header="HPWH Installation - Instructions">
      - Check the water pressure to the house, and ensure it is between 45 and 80 psi.
      If it is above 80 PSI, a whole house water pressure reducing/regulating valve should
      be installed to protect the water heater and water fixture valves in the house.
      - Check that the floor can support the weight of the HPWH when filled with water.
      This is especially important if the HPWH selected has a larger storage capacity than
      the original one.

      | Capacity (gal)| Filled Weight (lbs) |
      | --- | --- |
      | 50  | 573 |
      | 66  | 796 |
      | 80  | 921 |

      - Install the HPWH into a drain pan to protect the surrounding location from water
      damage if a leak occurs. Install the leak detection sensor into the drain pan if the
      HPWH includes one.
      - Rotate the HPWH during installation so that the exhaust does not face a solid wall.
      The exhaust of the HPWH must be more than the HPWH manufacturer's minimum required
      distance from a solid wall, usually 7 inches. If installing into a closet with a
      louvered door or high and low air grill, there is a maximum distance, typically around
      12 inches, between the exhaust and the louvers, refer to the manufacturer's specific
      instructions. The louvers on the door must extend to the bottom of the door to allow
      the cold air to fall out.
      - Replace the thermal expansion tank when replacing the water heater, expansion tanks
      typically last 5 to 10 years. Adjust the pre-charge pressure of the thermal expansion
      tank to match the home's water pressure using a tire pump. This 2009 Watts Water video
      shows how to do this step. Write down the pre-charge pressure onto the tank. A thermal
      expansion tank is not needed if the water heater is connected to a well pressure tank
      and there are no check valves to prevent backflow.
      - Follow local code requirements on dielectric unions and anti-siphon vacuum relief
      valve requirements. Flexible supply lines made of corrugated copper, corrugated
      stainless steel, and braided stainless steel often have dielectric sleeves in the
      design.
      - External heat traps are not if the HPWH has a built-in heat trap. To determine the
      presence of in-built heat traps, look at the cold water inlet and hot water outlet for
      plastic or metal hardware that captures a ball or rubber flap as shown in the examples
      below.

      <Figure src="/images/hpwh/heattraps.png" />

      - Do not make any soldered inlet and outlet connections while connected to the water
      heater, the built-in heat traps are plastic
      - Insulate the first 5 ft of hot water pipe to R-3 or more. If a recirculation pump is
      installed insulate all hot water and recirculation piping. Some HPWH rebates may
      require the recirculation pump to operate on a timer or demand button to reduce standby
      energy loss penalties.
      - The pressure relief valve discharge must terminate no more than 6 inches above the
      floor surface to a waste receptor or floor drain to prevent hot water discharge from
      being directed onto a building occupant that may be nearby.
      - The condensate is piped to a drain, sink, or condensate pump.
      - Install earthquake straps if required by local code to the bottom 1/3 and top 1/3 of
      the tank, do not install the straps to the heat pump portion.
      - Set the HPWH to hybrid mode.
      - Set the HPWH temperature to no more than 120 F. Setting temperatures higher than
      this requires a thermostatic mixing valve at the water heater to prevent scalding.

    ## HPWHW Post-Installation
    <Collapsible header="HPWH Post-Install – Instructions">
      Inform the homeowner on how to access the air filter to check and clean as needed. A
      filter check should be performed every three months. If dirty, clean the air filter by
      vacuuming the dust and washing with mild soap and detergent. Thoroughly dry before
      reinstalling.

      It is also suggested to inform the homeowner on how to perform the following annual
      water heaters checks that are not specific to a HPWH:
      1. Check the pressure relief valve by placing a small bucket at the end of the
      discharge pipe and pull and rotate the handle to open the valve for a few seconds to
      ensure it opens fully. When performing this check, stand back and wear closed-toe shoes
      to protect your feet from hot water. Once you begin to rotate the handle back close it
      should snap close by itself. The discharge pipe should stop dripping shortly. If it
      continues to drip, call a plumber to have the pressure relief valve replaced.
      2. Check the expansion tank. Remove the cap and briefly press in the Schrader valve to
      check that air (and not water) is expelled. If water is expelled the thermal expansion
      tank has failed and will need replacement, call a plumber to have the thermal expansion
      tank replaced. If air is expelled, the thermal expansion tank is working as expected.
      The pre-charge pressure of the thermal expansion tank can be checked by turning off the
      cold water main, opening a faucet to relieve the water pressure in the pipes, then
      checking the pre-charge with a tire pressure gauge. Adjust as needed using a tire pump
      to match the pressure written on the tank. Reinstall the cap on the Schrader valve if
      one is present, and reopen the cold water main shutoff valve.

    The HPWH has an air filter that must be checked and cleaned every 3 months.
    If dirty, clean the air filter by
    vacuuming the dust and washing with mild soap and detergent. Thoroughly dry before
    reinstalling.

    The following HPWH checks should be performed annually:
    1. Check the pressure relief valve by placing a small bucket at the end of the
    discharge pipe and pull and rotate the handle to open the valve for a few seconds to
    ensure it opens fully. When performing this check, stand back and wear closed-toe shoes

    2. Check the expansion tank. Remove the cap and briefly press in the Schrader valve to
    check that air (and not water) is expelled. If water is expelled the thermal expansion
    tank has failed and will need replacement, call a plumber to have the thermal expansion
    tank replaced. If air is expelled, the thermal expansion tank is working as expected.
    The pre-charge pressure of the thermal expansion tank can be checked by turning off the

    ## General HPWH Information
    An illustration of how a HPWH works is shown below.

    <Figure src="/images/hpwh/hpwh_components.jpeg">
      The components in a common HPWH (BASC 2015)
    </Figure>

    The heat pump uses 1/3 to 1/4 of the electricity to deliver the same heat into the water in the tank as
    an electric resistance element, but requires more time to do it.
    Most HPWHs have electric resistance elements to provide supplemental heat in certain modes.
    The HPWH will operate less efficiently when the electric resistance elements are used
    to provide supplemental heat. If the typical hot water demands are mostly satisfied by
    the stored hot water in the tank, then it does not affect user comfort whether the HPWH
    replenishes the heat in the tank quickly but less efficiently using the electric resistance elements
    or slower but much more
    efficiently using the heat pump.
