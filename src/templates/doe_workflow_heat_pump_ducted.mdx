        ## Visual Assessment of the Ductwork
        If the ducts will be entirely replaced or the visual inspection found significant duct upgrades and 
        repairs are needed: 
        - Make notes and skip performing a duct leakage test at the initial phase

            Correctly sizing the heat pump for the home’s heating and cooling needs is much more
            important for a heat pump than for a furnace and AC system. Use ACCA-approved Manual J
            residential load calculation software. It is recommended that the Manual J calculations be
            performed with the home occupant present that knows the most about the home to help
            determine the most accurate values to enter. Ask the home occupant whether any rooms
            presently get too hot or cold.

        ## Equipment Performance Tables
        You are encouraged to use the <a href="#" target="__new__">Cold Climate Heat Pump Decision Tool</a> which 
        can help assist in selecting the right heat pump for this home. The Cold Climate Heat Pump Decision Tool will 
        make use of the Manual J load values and the duct air flow capability test result data.  

        <Collapsible header="Equipment Selection Details">
            Select the equipment based on the ASHRAE heating and cooling design conditions, Manual J load calculation or 
            alternate load sizing method such as sizing the equipment to the air flow capability of the ducts if it is less 
            than the Manual J loads. The Cold Climate Heat Pump Decision Tool will recommend equipment sized to the capability of the ducts.
            
            Equipment selection also depends on knowing the equipment’s performance at specific temperatures. Reference 
            the manufacturer’s extended performance tables and/or the data from the NEEP Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pump List. 
            Factor in auxiliary heat, or dual fuel into the equipment selection as applicable. If the existing ducts can only 
            accommodate a heat pump below the size that is needed, discuss with the customer the option of upgrading the 
            ducts versus supplementing the central heat pump with one or more ductless heat pumps. Please add a comment 
            recording the decisions made.

            to the robustness of rubber seals. But after the core has been removed and reinstalled the 
            seal may experience difficulty sealing to another position with different surface conditions.

            # Central Ducted Split Heat Pump Upgrade
            ## Photo Report

            <ProjectInfoReport {...props} />
        
            ## About the Report:
            This report is intended to document:
            1. The critical tests for evaluating the ductwork in a home to determine what, if any, duct
            repairs or upgrades are needed so that the upgrade to a heat pump yields the expected
            efficiency benefits.
            2. The home’s heating and cooling loads.
            3. The heat pump equipment selection.
            4. The heat pump installation.
            
            A successful central ducted split heat pump installation starts with well-sealed, insulated, and
            correctly sized ductwork, and careful equipment planning and selection. Proper installation and
            commissioning are paramount to ensuring maximum equipment efficiency and a long troublefree equipment life.
            The photo requirements in this document record the key steps to ensure
            success. It is strongly recommended a printed copy of this report be attached to the air handler
            as a record to help future home energy raters and HVAC techs.
            
            ## About Atmospherically Vented Appliances
            If there there are atmospherically vented appliances inside the home after the heat pump installation, a combustion safety 
            test should have been performed to test for backdrafting. Please refer to the combustion safety documentation report if such a test was performed at this house.

            ODU – Outdoor Unit <br/>
            IDU – Outdoor Unit

            ## ATTENTION CUSTOMER: Heat Pump Cleaning and Maintenance
            ## Quarterly 
            ### Air Filter 
            Check the air filter quarterly and replace as needed. If your system was designed to take a 1" thick 
            pleated filter, they will get dirty and need to be replaced sooner than if the system was designed to 
            take a 4" filter. Ask your HVAC installer what filter MERV (minimum efficiency reporting value) rating 
            your heat pump was designed to take and purchase replacement filters of the same MERV value. Going with a 
            higher MERV rating can result in many unintended consequences including reduced air flow that results in 
            comfort problems and higher energy use.

            ## Twice a Year
            ### Outdoor Unit Condenser Coil 
            It is a best practice to inspect the outdoor unit at least twice a year for debris build up on the 
            condenser coil. Leaves, pollen, and fluff from cottonwood trees can build up and block the movement of air
             through the condenser coil and cause poor performance. You can carefully clean loose debris off the 
             condenser coil using a vacuum cleaner and a soft brush. Take care to not bend the fins on the condenser 
             coil. For more stubborn or stickier dust, it is best practice to call an HVAC service tech. They will 
             spray down your coil with the correct cleaning detergent to not damage the material and disassemble the 
             outdoor unit enough to spray water from the inside to push out the dust and debris and rinse the coil 
             free of the cleaning detergent.

            ### Supply Vents
            It is a best practice to vacuum the supply grilles twice a year. If the supply grilles are located on 
            the floor it is best practice to remove the supply grill and use the vacuum’s crevice tool to vacuum 
            the area of the supply duct that can be reached.

            ## Yearly
            ### Condensate Drain
            It is a best practice to inspect the end of the condensate drain yearly. If there is a buildup of 
            goo/slime/mucus/snot at the end of the condensate drain line, it is time to call a HVAC service tech. 
            They will use the combination of a shop vac, drain snakes, and pressurized water to clean out the 
            condensate drain line.

            ## Static Pressure Test Results
            Total external static pressure measurement: This measurement is akin to taking the blood pressure of a person. 
            Having high blood pressure is an indicator of poor health. The same is true for a HVAC system. For an HVAC system, 
            having a total external static pressure value of 0.5 i.w.c or less is good. The ducts can be repaired or upgraded 
            to bring a high value down to a healthy value.

            ## Airflow Test Results
            In order for a heat pump to efficiently and effectively deliver the conditioned air to the house, 
            the ducts need to be able to move enough air. This test uses the home's existing air handler to measure how much air the ducts can move. 
            If they cannot move enough air, the ducts will need to be repaired or upgraded so that they can move enough air.

             ## Duck Leakage Test Results
             Leaky ducts mean the conditioned air doesn't make it to the rooms where the conditioned air is needed. 
             The worse kind of duct leakage is leakage to outside because that means the air you paid to conditioned 
             is leaking outside the house. The duct leakage test measures how leaky 
             the ducts are. Newly constructed homes have a duct leakage limit of 4 CFM25 per 100 ft<sup>2</sup> of conditioned floor area. 
             In existing construction it is highly recommended that action be taken to reduce duct leakage if 
             the duct leakage test finds the leakage rate to be greater than 12 CFM25 per 100 ft<sup>2</sup> of conditioned floor area.

              A passing temperature-compensated nitrogen pressure decay test will show zero or almost zero pressure decay after 10 minutes. 
              This means the system's connections have been tested to withstand the maximum operating pressures and there are no leaks in the system.

                A good vacuum decay test setup will have the micron gauge located as close to the equipment as possible. It will have an isolation
                 valve in the setup so that the vacuum pump and vacuum hose can be isolated from the system during the decay measurement period.

            <Photo id="vacuum_decay_test_results_photo" label="Vacuum Decay Test Results – Photo" required >
                A passing vacuum decay test is one where the system's vacuum does not rise above 500 microns in 10 minutes with the vacuum pump and 
                vacuum hose isolated from the system. This indicates the system contains no moisture and is leak free.
