    ##### HPWH Space Evaluation
    <Collapsible header="HPWH Space Evaluation — Instructions">
      The successful installation of a heat pump water heater (HPWH) begins in the planning
      stage by assessing whether the location where the HPWH will be installed is suitable.
      The space around the HPWH must be...
      1. large enough to meet the air volume requirement (700 ft3 minimum) of the HPWH,
      2. where some compressor and fan noise (50 to 65 dB, normal conversation loudness) is
      acceptable,
      3. where some cooled air (approximately a half-ton) is acceptable or desirable,
      4. not dusty, or where a significant amount of dust is generated,
      5. tall enough (~12” taller than the current tank height, ~76” if < 65 gals to ~ 86” if >= 80
      gals) to allow the filter in the HPWH to be periodically accessed for cleaning,
      6. where there is access to a drain, drain line, or utility sink for condensate, and
      7. in the 40°–125° F (4.4°–51° C) temperature range year-round

      It is possible to also meet the air volume requirement of the HPWH by installing it next
      to a louvered door, or ducting the supply, exhaust, or both the supply and the exhaust
      of the HPWH to an adjacent space. It is also possible to install a condensate pump where
      a drain located below the elevation of the HPWH’s condensate outlet is not available.

      To verify conditions 1-7 have been met please use the "HPWH Location" photo input to
      take a
      wide-angle picture of the space where the HPWH will be installed. If the HPWH is to
      be ducted or using the air volume of an adjacent space via a louvered door,
      please supply a photo of the connected space using the "Adjacent Space" photo input.
      Also use the "Space Air Volume Calculator" table to calculate the Air Volume of the space that the HPWH is
      using to meet its air volume requirement.

##### Old Water Heater
<PhotoInput id="old_nameplate_photo" label="Old Water Heater Nameplate – Photo">
  For some jurisdictions, rebates for an HPWH might be conditioned on not only the
  efficiency specifications of the HPWH but also the fuel type of the existing water
  heater the HPWH is replacing. For jurisdictions where this applies, please provide
  a photo of the nameplate showing the model number,
  fuel type, and the serial number of the old water heater.

##### HPWH Selection

<Collapsible header="HPWH Selection – Instructions">
  The efficiency of HPWHs is profoundly affected by the way hot water is used and thus,
  selecting the right sized HPWH is important to user satisfaction.
  Most HPWHs on the market are the type with a small heat pump (e.g., 550-watt compressor)
  on top of a storage water heater tank. These products have a refrigerant loop
  heat exchanger wrapped around and integrated into the tank as well as electric
  resistance elements to provide supplemental/back up heat when hot water demands
  deplete the tank faster than the small heat pump can replenish the tank with heat.
  An illustration of how a HPWH works is shown below.

  <Figure src="/images/hpwh/hpwh_components.jpeg">
    The components in a common HPWH (BASC 2015)
  </Figure>

  The heat pump can deliver the same heat into the water in the tank using 1/3 to ¼ of
  the electricity of the electric resistance elements but requires more time to do this.
  The HPWH will operate less efficiently when the electric resistance elements are used
  to provide supplemental heat. If the typical hot water demands are mostly satisfied by
  the stored hot water in the tank, then it does not affect user comfort whether the HPWH
  replenishes the heat in the tank quickly but less efficiently or slower but much more
  efficiently. Water heater manufacturers list how much hot water a water heater can
  supply during a period of high demand using a metric called the first-hour rating (FHR).
  The first-hour rating (FHR) is a hot water delivery calculation that factors in both
  the water heater volume and the heating rate. Since the heat pump heats the water
  slowly, the tank volume of hot water will largely determine the FHR in a HPWH. This is
  why selecting a HPWH with a tank large enough to satisfy the peak hour of hot water
  demand is important in selecting the correct HPWH for the needs of the house.

  To estimate your peak hour demand:
  - Determine what time of day (morning, noon, evening) you use the highest amount of
  hot water in your home. Keep in mind the number of people living in your home.
  - Use the worksheet below to estimate your maximum usage of hot water during this
  one-hour period of the day—this is your peak hour demand. Note: the worksheet does not
  estimate total daily hot water usage.

##### HPWHW Installation
<Collapsible header="HPWH Installation - Instructions">
- Check the water pressure to the house, and ensure it is between 45 and 80 psi.
If it is above 80 PSI, a whole house water pressure reducing/regulating valve should
be installed to protect the water heater and water fixture valves in the house.
- Check that the floor can support the weight of the HPWH when filled with water.
This is especially important if the HPWH selected has a larger storage capacity than
the original one.

| Capcity (gal)| Filled Weight (lbs) |
| --- | --- |
| 50  | 573 |
| 66  | 796 |
| 80  | 921 |

- Install the HPWH into a drain pan to protect the surrounding location from water
damage if a leak occurs. Install the leak detection sensor into the drain pan if the
HPWH includes one.
- Rotate the HPWH during installation so that the exhaust does not face a solid wall.
The exhaust of the HPWH must be more than the HPWH manufacturer’s minimum required
distance from a solid wall, usually 7 inches. If installing into a closet with a
louvered door or high and low air grill, there is a maximum distance, typically around
12 inches, between the exhaust and the louvers, refer to the manufacturer’s specific
instructions. The louvers on the door must extend to the bottom of the door to allow
the cold air to fall out.
- Replace the thermal expansion tank when replacing the water heater, expansion tanks
typically last 5 to 10 years. Adjust the pre-charge pressure of the thermal expansion
tank to match the home’s water pressure using a tire pump. This 2009 Watts Water video
shows how to do this step. Write down the pre-charge pressure onto the tank. A thermal
expansion tank is not needed if the water heater is connected to a well pressure tank
and there are no check valves to prevent backflow.
- Follow local code requirements on dielectric unions and anti-siphon vacuum relief
valve requirements. Flexible supply lines made of corrugated copper, corrugated
stainless steel, and braided stainless steel often have dielectric sleeves in the
design.
- External heat traps are not if the HPWH has a built-in heat trap. To determine the
presence of in-built heat traps, look at the cold water inlet and hot water outlet for
plastic or metal hardware that captures a ball or rubber flap as shown in the examples
below.

<Figure src="/images/hpwh/heattraps.png" />

- Do not make any soldered inlet and outlet connections while connected to the water
heater, the built-in heat traps are plastic
- Insulate the first 5 ft of hot water pipe to R-3 or more. If a recirculation pump is
installed insulate all hot water and recirculation piping. Some HPWH rebates may
require the recirculation pump to operate on a timer or demand button to reduce standby
energy loss penalties.
- The pressure relief valve discharge must terminate no more than 6 inches above the
floor surface to a waste receptor or floor drain to prevent hot water discharge from
being directed onto a building occupant that may be nearby.
- The condensate is piped to a drain, sink, or condensate pump.
- Install earthquake straps if required by local code to the bottom 1/3 and top 1/3 of
the tank, do not install the straps to the heat pump portion.
- Set the HPWH to hybrid mode.
- Set the HPWH temperature to no more than 120 F. Setting temperatures higher than
this requires a thermostatic mixing valve at the water heater to prevent scalding.

##### HPWHW Post-Installation
<Collapsible header="HPWH Post-Install – Instructions">
Inform the homeowner on how to access the air filter to check and clean as needed. A
filter check should be performed every 3 months. If dirty, clean the air filter by
vacuuming the dust and washing with mild soap and detergent. Thoroughly dry before
reinstalling.

It is also suggested to inform the homeowner on how to perform the following annual
water heaters checks that are not specific to a HPWH:
1. Check the pressure relief valve by placing a small bucket at the end of the
discharge pipe and pull and rotate the handle to open the valve for a few seconds to
ensure it opens fully. When performing this check, stand back and wear closed-toe shoes
to protect your feet from hot water. Once you begin to rotate the handle back close it
should snap close by itself. The discharge pipe should stop dripping shortly. If it
continues to drip, call a plumber to have the pressure relief valve replaced.
2. Check the expansion tank. Remove the cap and briefly press in the Schrader valve to
check that air (and not water) is expelled. If water is expelled the thermal expansion
tank has failed and will need replacement, call a plumber to have the thermal expansion
tank replaced. If air is expelled, the thermal expansion tank is working as expected.
The pre-charge pressure of the thermal expansion tank can be checked by turning off the
cold water main, opening a faucet to relieve the water pressure in the pipes, then
checking the pre-charge with a tire pressure gauge. Adjust as needed using a tire pump
to match the pressure written on the tank. Reinstall the cap on the Schrader valve if
one is present, and reopen the cold water main shutoff valve.
