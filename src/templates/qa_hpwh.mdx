    ##### HPWH Space Evaluation
    <Collapsible header="HPWH Space Evaluation — Instructions">
      The successful installation of a heat pump water heater (HPWH) begins in the planning
      stage by assessing whether the location where the HPWH will be installed is suitable.
      The space around the HPWH must be:
      1. Large enough to meet the minimum HPWH air volume requirement of 700 ft<sup>3</sup>
      2. Where some compressor and fan noise (50 to 65 dB, normal conversation loudness) is
      acceptable
      3. Where the cooled air exhausted from the HPWH (approximately a half-ton) is acceptable or desirable
      4. Not dusty, or where a significant amount of dust is generated
      5. Tall enough (~12” taller than the tank height, ~76” if < 65 gals to ~86” if &ge; 80
      gals) to allow the filter in the HPWH to be periodically accessed for cleaning
      6. Where there is access to a drain, drain line, or utility sink for condensate
      7. In the 40°F–125°F (4.4°C–51°C) temperature range year-round

      It is possible to also meet the air volume requirement of the HPWH by installing it next
      to a louvered door, or ducting the supply, exhaust, or both the supply and the exhaust
      of the HPWH to an adjacent space. It is also possible to install a condensate pump where
      a drain located below the elevation of the HPWH’s condensate outlet is not available.

    <Collapsible header="HPWH Selection – Instructions">
      The efficiency of HPWHs is profoundly affected by the way hot water is used and thus,
      selecting the right sized HPWH is important to user satisfaction.
      Most HPWHs on the market are the type with a small heat pump (e.g., 550-watt compressor)
      on top of a storage water heater tank. These products have a refrigerant loop
      heat exchanger wrapped around and integrated into the tank as well as electric
      resistance elements to provide supplemental/back up heat when hot water demands
      deplete the tank faster than the small heat pump can replenish the tank with heat.
      An illustration of how a HPWH works is shown below.

      <Figure src="/images/hpwh/hpwh_components.jpeg">
        The components in a common HPWH (BASC 2015)
      </Figure>

      The heat pump can deliver the same heat into the water in the tank using 1/3 to ¼ of
      the electricity of the electric resistance elements but requires more time to do this.
      The HPWH will operate less efficiently when the electric resistance elements are used
      to provide supplemental heat. If the typical hot water demands are mostly satisfied by
      the stored hot water in the tank, then it does not affect user comfort whether the HPWH
      replenishes the heat in the tank quickly but less efficiently or slower but much more
      efficiently. Water heater manufacturers list how much hot water a water heater can
      supply during a period of high demand using a metric called the first-hour rating (FHR).
      The first-hour rating (FHR) is a hot water delivery calculation that factors in both
      the water heater volume and the heating rate. Since the heat pump heats the water
      slowly, the tank volume of hot water will largely determine the FHR in a HPWH. This is
      why selecting a HPWH with a tank large enough to satisfy the peak hour of hot water
      demand is important in selecting the correct HPWH for the needs of the house.

      To estimate your peak hour demand:
      - Determine what time of day (morning, noon, evening) you use the highest amount of
      hot water in your home. Keep in mind the number of people living in your home.
      - Use the worksheet below to estimate your maximum usage of hot water during this
      one-hour period of the day—this is your peak hour demand. Note: the worksheet does not
      estimate total daily hot water usage.

    <Collapsible header="HPWH Installation - Instructions">
      - Check the water pressure to the house, and ensure it is between 45 and 80 psi.
      If it is above 80 PSI, a whole house water pressure reducing/regulating valve should
      be installed to protect the water heater and water fixture valves in the house.
      - Check that the floor can support the weight of the HPWH when filled with water.
      This is especially important if the HPWH selected has a larger storage capacity than
      the original one.

  | Capcity (gal)| Filled Weight (lbs) | 
  | --- | --- | 
  | 50  | 573 | 
  | 66  | 796 | 
  | 80  | 921 | 

      - Install the HPWH into a drain pan to protect the surrounding location from water
      damage if a leak occurs. Install the leak detection sensor into the drain pan if the
      HPWH includes one.
      - Rotate the HPWH during installation so that the exhaust does not face a solid wall.
      The exhaust of the HPWH must be more than the HPWH manufacturer’s minimum required
      distance from a solid wall, usually 7 inches. If installing into a closet with a
      louvered door or high and low air grill, there is a maximum distance, typically around
      12 inches, between the exhaust and the louvers, refer to the manufacturer’s specific
      instructions. The louvers on the door must extend to the bottom of the door to allow
      the cold air to fall out.
      - Replace the thermal expansion tank when replacing the water heater, expansion tanks
      typically last 5 to 10 years. Adjust the pre-charge pressure of the thermal expansion
      tank to match the home’s water pressure using a tire pump. This 2009 Watts Water video
      shows how to do this step. Write down the pre-charge pressure onto the tank. A thermal
      expansion tank is not needed if the water heater is connected to a well pressure tank
      and there are no check valves to prevent backflow.
      - Follow local code requirements on dielectric unions and anti-siphon vacuum relief
      valve requirements. Flexible supply lines made of corrugated copper, corrugated
      stainless steel, and braided stainless steel often have dielectric sleeves in the
      design.
      - External heat traps are not if the HPWH has a built-in heat trap. To determine the
      presence of in-built heat traps, look at the cold water inlet and hot water outlet for
      plastic or metal hardware that captures a ball or rubber flap as shown in the examples
      below.

      <Figure src="/images/hpwh/heattraps.png" />

      - Do not make any soldered inlet and outlet connections while connected to the water
      heater, the built-in heat traps are plastic
      - Insulate the first 5 ft of hot water pipe to R-3 or more. If a recirculation pump is
      installed insulate all hot water and recirculation piping. Some HPWH rebates may
      require the recirculation pump to operate on a timer or demand button to reduce standby
      energy loss penalties.
      - The pressure relief valve discharge must terminate no more than 6 inches above the
      floor surface to a waste receptor or floor drain to prevent hot water discharge from
      being directed onto a building occupant that may be nearby.
      - The condensate is piped to a drain, sink, or condensate pump.
      - Install earthquake straps if required by local code to the bottom 1/3 and top 1/3 of
      the tank, do not install the straps to the heat pump portion.
      - Set the HPWH to hybrid mode.
      - Set the HPWH temperature to no more than 120 F. Setting temperatures higher than
      this requires a thermostatic mixing valve at the water heater to prevent scalding.

    ##### HPWHW Post-Installation
    <Collapsible header="HPWH Post-Install – Instructions">
      Inform the homeowner on how to access the air filter to check and clean as needed. A
      filter check should be performed every 3 months. If dirty, clean the air filter by
      vacuuming the dust and washing with mild soap and detergent. Thoroughly dry before
      reinstalling.

      It is also suggested to inform the homeowner on how to perform the following annual
      water heaters checks that are not specific to a HPWH:
      1. Check the pressure relief valve by placing a small bucket at the end of the
      discharge pipe and pull and rotate the handle to open the valve for a few seconds to
      ensure it opens fully. When performing this check, stand back and wear closed-toe shoes
      to protect your feet from hot water. Once you begin to rotate the handle back close it
      should snap close by itself. The discharge pipe should stop dripping shortly. If it
      continues to drip, call a plumber to have the pressure relief valve replaced.
      2. Check the expansion tank. Remove the cap and briefly press in the Schrader valve to
      check that air (and not water) is expelled. If water is expelled the thermal expansion
      tank has failed and will need replacement, call a plumber to have the thermal expansion
      tank replaced. If air is expelled, the thermal expansion tank is working as expected.
      The pre-charge pressure of the thermal expansion tank can be checked by turning off the
      cold water main, opening a faucet to relieve the water pressure in the pipes, then
      checking the pre-charge with a tire pressure gauge. Adjust as needed using a tire pump
      to match the pressure written on the tank. Reinstall the cap on the Schrader valve if
      one is present, and reopen the cold water main shutoff valve.

    <Collapsible header="About the Report">
    This report is intended to document the critical details of upgrading to a heat pump water heater spanning from the evaluative, pre-installation, steps including evaluating the space to ensure it is suitable for a heat pump water heater (HPWH) and selecting the right sized HPWH to the completed HPWH installation. 

    ## About home performance
    Treating a home as a system is a core principle of the home performance program. This means health and safety is the most important and thus matters that affect it need to be addressed first and foremost. Next in the order of importance is to ensure the home is properly managing bulk water from rain, snow, or groundwater since bulk water entering where it should not will rapidly cause mold and moisture damage to building materials. Next in the order of importance is to ensure the home doesn’t have significant air leakages which carries with it humidity that can condense and cause mold and moisture damage to building materials. While comfort and energy efficiency of the home are important, the aforementioned elements are more important. The program does not promote energy efficiency upgrades if the home needs more important repairs, remediations, and upgrades first to uphold and protect this building science order of importance and will ensure that any energy efficiency upgrade does not cause a health and safety problem to the home.

    ## About Naturally Drafted Fossil Fuel Appliances Inside the Home:
    If the old water heater is a naturally drafted, also known as an atmospherically vented water heater and there are other naturally drafted fossil fuel appliances inside the pressure boundary of the home, the naturally drafted fossil fuel appliances will be tested for proper draft and combustion during the evaluative step and after the heat pump water heater is installed. While unlikely, there is a small possibility that removing the naturally drafted water heater could cause remaining combustion appliances that share the chimney flue to fail to draft properly when the dryer, range hood, and exhaust fans are operated simultaneously in concert with the remaining naturally drafted combustion appliances. If this is found to be the case the contractor will remediate this health and safety impacting condition. The solution could include flue pipe modifications, adding a make-up air supply to the combustion appliance area or some other solution. The homeowner/landlord should be aware of this possibility and the costs of this remediation action.

      slowly, the tank volume of hot water will largely determine the FHR in a HPWH. This is
      why selecting a HPWH with a tank large enough to satisfy the peak hour of hot water
      demand is important in selecting the correct HPWH for the needs of the house.

      To estimate your peak hour demand:
      - Determine what time of day (morning, noon, evening) you use the highest amount of
      hot water in your home. Keep in mind the number of people living in your home.
      - Use the worksheet below to estimate your maximum usage of hot water during this
      one-hour period of the day—this is your peak hour demand. Note: the worksheet does not
      estimate total daily hot water usage.

      - Check the water pressure to the house, and ensure it is between 45 and 80 psi.
      If it is above 80 PSI, a whole house water pressure reducing/regulating valve should
      be installed to protect the water heater and water fixture valves in the house.
      - Check that the floor can support the weight of the HPWH when filled with water.
      This is especially important if the HPWH selected has a larger storage capacity than
      the original one.

      | Capcity (gal)| Filled Weight (lbs) |
      | --- | --- |
      | 50  | 573 |
      | 66  | 796 |
      | 80  | 921 |

      - Install the HPWH into a drain pan to protect the surrounding location from water
      damage if a leak occurs. Install the leak detection sensor into the drain pan if the
      HPWH includes one.
      - Rotate the HPWH during installation so that the exhaust does not face a solid wall.
      The exhaust of the HPWH must be more than the HPWH manufacturer’s minimum required
      distance from a solid wall, usually 7 inches. If installing into a closet with a
      louvered door or high and low air grill, there is a maximum distance, typically around
      12 inches, between the exhaust and the louvers, refer to the manufacturer’s specific
      instructions. The louvers on the door must extend to the bottom of the door to allow
      the cold air to fall out.
      - Replace the thermal expansion tank when replacing the water heater, expansion tanks
      typically last 5 to 10 years. Adjust the pre-charge pressure of the thermal expansion
      tank to match the home’s water pressure using a tire pump. This 2009 Watts Water video
      shows how to do this step. Write down the pre-charge pressure onto the tank. A thermal
      expansion tank is not needed if the water heater is connected to a well pressure tank
      and there are no check valves to prevent backflow.
      - Follow local code requirements on dielectric unions and anti-siphon vacuum relief
      valve requirements. Flexible supply lines made of corrugated copper, corrugated
      stainless steel, and braided stainless steel often have dielectric sleeves in the
      design.
      - External heat traps are not if the HPWH has a built-in heat trap. To determine the
      presence of in-built heat traps, look at the cold water inlet and hot water outlet for
      plastic or metal hardware that captures a ball or rubber flap as shown in the examples
      below.

      <Figure src="/images/hpwh/heattraps.png" />

      - Do not make any soldered inlet and outlet connections while connected to the water
      heater, the built-in heat traps are plastic
      - Insulate the first 5 ft of hot water pipe to R-3 or more. If a recirculation pump is
      installed insulate all hot water and recirculation piping. Some HPWH rebates may
      require the recirculation pump to operate on a timer or demand button to reduce standby
      energy loss penalties.
      - The pressure relief valve discharge must terminate no more than 6 inches above the
      floor surface to a waste receptor or floor drain to prevent hot water discharge from
      being directed onto a building occupant that may be nearby.
      - The condensate is piped to a drain, sink, or condensate pump.
      - Install earthquake straps if required by local code to the bottom 1/3 and top 1/3 of
      the tank, do not install the straps to the heat pump portion.
      - Set the HPWH to hybrid mode.
      - Set the HPWH temperature to no more than 120 F. Setting temperatures higher than
      this requires a thermostatic mixing valve at the water heater to prevent scalding.

    ##### HPWHW Post-Installation
    <Collapsible header="HPWH Post-Install – Instructions">
      Inform the homeowner on how to access the air filter to check and clean as needed. A
      filter check should be performed every 3 months. If dirty, clean the air filter by
      vacuuming the dust and washing with mild soap and detergent. Thoroughly dry before
      reinstalling.

      It is also suggested to inform the homeowner on how to perform the following annual
      water heaters checks that are not specific to a HPWH:
      1. Check the pressure relief valve by placing a small bucket at the end of the
      discharge pipe and pull and rotate the handle to open the valve for a few seconds to
      ensure it opens fully. When performing this check, stand back and wear closed-toe shoes
      to protect your feet from hot water. Once you begin to rotate the handle back close it
      should snap close by itself. The discharge pipe should stop dripping shortly. If it
      continues to drip, call a plumber to have the pressure relief valve replaced.
      2. Check the expansion tank. Remove the cap and briefly press in the Schrader valve to
      check that air (and not water) is expelled. If water is expelled the thermal expansion
      tank has failed and will need replacement, call a plumber to have the thermal expansion
      tank replaced. If air is expelled, the thermal expansion tank is working as expected.
      The pre-charge pressure of the thermal expansion tank can be checked by turning off the
      cold water main, opening a faucet to relieve the water pressure in the pipes, then
      checking the pre-charge with a tire pressure gauge. Adjust as needed using a tire pump
      to match the pressure written on the tank. Reinstall the cap on the Schrader valve if
      one is present, and reopen the cold water main shutoff valve.
