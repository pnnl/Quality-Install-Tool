    ## Existing Conditions
    <Collapsible header="Existing Conditions">
      The application of air permeable insulation without first air sealing is not an acceptable practice.
      E.g. just blowing an attic with loose fill fiberglass, cellulose, or mineral wood without first checking
      air sealing details have been performed is not an acceptable practice. Instead, air sealing efforts should
      precede insulation work unless the insulation is spray foam. Have a conversation with the customer about the added
      cost of removing existing insulation and the benefits it offers toward achieving better air sealing.

      The air sealing and insulation don’t have to be done by the same contractor. While not required,
      often to achieve comprehensive high quality air sealing, the attic first needs to be cleaned of dust, debris,
      and/or degraded insulation. Prior to air sealing inspect the attic for damaged or missing framing members,
      exhaust fans venting to the attic, unsafe electrical wiring, water leaks, mold, poor condition duct work,
      and old or unsafe HVAC or water heating appliances. Repairing, upgrading, and replacing these things in the
      attic afterwards can significantly damage or disturb the air sealing and insulation. Consider removing no
      longer used things such a TV antenna and landline telephone wires during the attic air sealing and insulation project.

    ## General Safety
    <Collapsible header="General Safety">
        Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. Some common causes of mold or moisture issues include a leaky roof, leaky ducts and clogged gutter or drainage systems.
    </Collapsible>

    <Collapsible header="Roof condition">
    * Look for water stains, mold, or signs of pest entry. Water and moisture issues from a leaky roof can be made worse once the attic has been air sealed and insulated because afterwards there is less heat escaping to dry the roof/attic.
    * Pest entry can rapidly damage air sealing and insulation materials thus it is important to check and remediate prior to work.
