    ## Installation
    A project that involves replacing an electrical panel may include adding electrical wiring upgrades/additions
    to future proof the home such adding wires for a future electric heat pump water heater, heat pump,
    whole house mechanical ventilation, induction cooktop/range, electric heat pump clothes dryer, solar
    PV + batteries, and a Level 2 electric vehicle charger even if the home currently doesn’t have these
    electrical appliances. At minimum the upgraded electrical panel should have enough open breaker spots
    to support the future full electrification of the home.
