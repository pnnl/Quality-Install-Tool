    <PhotoInput id="installation_location_at_completion_photo" label="Installation Location at Completion – Photo">
      Take a wide-angle photo of the installation location at completion.
      - To show that there are no adjacent hazards, if installed in a garage this photo would show that the installation is at least 18 in. above the floor and protected from vehicle damage.
      -	To show all pipes have been clearly labeled and flow direction indicated
      -	To show the water pipes have been insulated especially the hot water pipe and recirculation lines if present.
      -	To show the air inlet air filter has been clearly labeled for periodic inspection

All clearance requirements are in accordance with ANZI Z21 .10.3 and the National Fuel Gas Code, ANSI Z223.1 / NFPA 54 and CGA 8149.1 National Gas and Propane Installation Code.
        -	To show that the wall penetration for the vent has been flashed correctly.
        -	Install the termination high enough so that snow drifts won’t block the vent.
        -	Install termination fittings in a manner to prevent short circuit of air from exhaust to intake.
        -	The installation of bird screens are recommended
