    # Attic Air Sealing Upgrade
    ## Photo Report

    <ProjectInfoReport {...props} />
  

    ## About the Report
    This report is intended to show: 
    1.	The air leakage rate of the home before attic envelope upgrades were performed, and 
    2.	The critical details of the attic air sealing upgrades that were performed 

    The report is not intended to be technically exhaustive, neither every single feature nor every example of every feature was photographed. 
    The report does not imply that every single location that could have been air sealed and insulated was air sealed and insulated 100% perfectly, 
    however, the contractor has made diligent effort to be meticulous and do a quality job. 

    ## About Naturally Drafted Fossil Fuel Appliances Inside the Home:
    Naturally drafted fossil fuel appliances inside the pressure boundary of the home will be tested for proper draft and combustion during the 
    pre-envelope upgrade health and safety inspection. However, there is the possibility that the comprehensive envelope air sealing and 
    insulation energy efficiency upgrades could cause the naturally drafted water heater or furnace to fail to draft properly when dryers, 
    range hoods, and exhaust fans are operated simultaneously with the naturally drafted water heater and/or furnace. If this is found to be the case, 
    a combustion air opening connecting the combustion appliance area to the outdoors may need to be added or some other remediation may be required. 
    The homeowner/landlord should be aware of this possibility and the costs of this remediation action. 

    ## About Mechanical Ventilation:
    One important aspect of a comprehensive energy efficiency upgrade is taking control of the air flowing in and out of the home. 
    Without proper air sealing, the air flows in and out wherever it wants to, and primarily when it is very hot or very cold. 
    This leads to comfort issues (drafts) and wasted energy. It also leads to moisture problems when the moisture in that air gets into the wall,
     attic, or floor assemblies. To avoid these issues while providing adequate fresh air where and when it is needed, the strategy is to seal air 
     leaks, especially high (attic) and low (basement or crawlspace) and then provide continuous mechanical ventilation with optional filtering or
     other conditioning.
