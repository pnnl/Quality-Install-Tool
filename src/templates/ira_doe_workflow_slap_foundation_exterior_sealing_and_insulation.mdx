    ## General Safety
    <Collapsible header="General Safety">
        Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. Some common causes of mold or moisture issues include a leaky roof, leaky ducts and clogged gutter or drainage systems.
    </Collapsible>



    <Collapsible header="Drainage condition">
    Check the grade around the home is sloped away from the house, check for standing water in the crawlspace or
    basement floor, check the gutters and downspouts are in good condition.

    <Radio label="What is the drainage system condition?" options={['Good','Potential Issue']} path="drainage_condition" />

    <Collapsible header="Mold or Moisture in or Outside the Home">
    Contractors should perform this inspection prior to work as protection against being blamed for a pre-existing
    mold or moisture problem. Air sealing and insulation can make a pre-existing mold or moisture problem worse,
    thus it is important to check for the safety of the customer.
    </Collapsible>
    <Radio label="Are there signs of mold or moisture in or outside the home?" options={['Yes','No']} path="signs_of_mold_or_moisture" />

    <Collapsible header="Pre-retrofit mechanical ventilation calculation">
    *	The pre-retrofit ventilation calculation can help estimate whether mechanical ventilation will be needed post air sealing and insulation work.
    * Consider using RED Calc ASHRAE 62.2 tools to do the mechanical ventilation calculation. https://basc.pnnl.gov/redcalc
      *	Consider infiltration credits. A very leaky home may still be leaky enough after the scoped air sealing and insulation work is completed.
    *	The ASHRAE 62.2 standard does not require the installation of a system smaller than 15 CFM (7 L/s)

     * If the home’s walls were built on top of the concrete slab foundation without a sill gasket
     to break the capillary action, the walls could have moisture problems. Probing the sill plate
     with a pin type moisture sensor can determine of there is a moisture problem that should be
     addressed prior to air sealing and insulation.
     * If the sill plates are indeed wet due to the lack of a sill gasket, the walls can be lifted
     with jacks just enough to retrofit a sill gasket. This work is invasive and will damage air
     sealing and insulation work, thus it should be done prior.
