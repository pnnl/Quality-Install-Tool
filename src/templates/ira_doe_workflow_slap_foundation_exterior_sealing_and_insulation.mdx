    ## General Safety
    <Collapsible header="General Safety">
        Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. Some common causes of mold or moisture issues include a leaky roof, leaky ducts and clogged gutter or drainage systems.
    </Collapsible>

    <Collapsible header="Roof condition">   
    * Look for water stains, mold, or signs of pest entry. Water and moisture issues from a leaky roof can be made worse once the attic has been air sealed and insulated because afterwards there is less heat escaping to dry the roof/attic.
    * Pest entry can rapidly damage air sealing and insulation materials thus it is important to check and remediate prior to work. 
    </Collapsible>
    <Radio label="What is the roof condition?" options={['Good','Potential Issue']} path="roof_condition" />

    <Collapsible header="Drainage condition"> 
    Check the grade around the home is sloped away from the house, check for standing water in the crawlspace or 
    basement floor, check the gutters and downspouts are in good condition. Once the attic has been air sealed and 
    insulated there is less heat escaping to dry the roof/attic thus water damage caused by clogged gutter will be 
    much worse. Once the attic has been air sealed and insulated the amount of air exfiltrating through the attic 
    is reduced and therefore the amount of air infiltrating into the crawlspace/basement is also reduced. 
    Thus, even though attic air sealing and insulation of the attic is being performed, it can reduce the drying 
    force of the crawlspace/basement, thus pre-existing moisture problems in the crawlspace/basement can be made 
    worse by this action. Thus, it is a good practice to check and document pre-existing problems.

    <Collapsible header="Mold or Moisture in or Outside the Home"> 
    Contractors should perform this inspection prior to work as protection against being blamed for a pre-existing 
    mold or moisture problem. Air sealing and insulation can make a pre-existing mold or moisture problem worse, 
    thus it is important to check for the safety of the customer.

    *	The pre-retrofit ventilation calculation can help estimate whether mechanical ventilation will be needed post air sealing and insulation work.
    *	Consider infiltration credits. A very leaky home may still be leaky enough after the scoped air sealing and insulation work is completed.

     * If the home’s walls were built on top of the concrete slab foundation without a sill gasket 
     to break the capillary action, the walls could have moisture problems. Probing the sill plate 
     with a pin type moisture sensor can determine of there is a moisture problem that should be 
     addressed prior to air sealing and insulation.
     * If the sill plates are indeed wet due to the lack of a sill gasket, the walls can be lifted 
     with jacks just enough to retrofit a sill gasket. This work is invasive and will damage air 
     sealing and insulation work, thus it should be done prior.
