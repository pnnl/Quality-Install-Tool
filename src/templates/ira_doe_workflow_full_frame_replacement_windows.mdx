    This workflow is for the window replacement method where the entire old window is removed and a new window, 
    typically one with nail fins, is installed. This method often requires careful cutting back of siding (stucco, 
    fiber cement, vinyl, wood, and metal) or removing trim pieces to access the nail fins. On homes with stone, 
    brick or brick veneer siding, this method may not be possible.
  
    
    ## Before Removal of Old Window
    <PhotoInput id="outside_photo" label="Outside – Photo">
      Take a photo of the original window from the outside.
    </PhotoInput>

    <PhotoInput id="inside_photo" label="Inside – Photo">
      Take a photo of the original window from the inside.
    </PhotoInput>

    ## Immediately After Removing the Window 
    <PhotoInput id="after_removing_outside_sill_area_photo" label="Outside Sill Area – Photo">
      Take a photo of the sill section of the rough opening after the window has been removed. 
      This photo should show the existing siding, sheathing, and framing material are in good condition, 
      e.g. no water damage, dry rot, or damage by pests. If any of these issues are found, 
      they must repaired before continuing.
    </PhotoInput>

    <PhotoInput id="after_removing_outside_head_area_photo" label="Outside Head Area – Photo">
      Take a photo of the head section of the rough opening after the window has been removed. 
      This photo should show the existing siding, sheathing, and framing material are in good 
      condition, e.g. no water damage, dry rot, or damage by pests. If any of these issues are found, 
      they must repaired before continuing.

      Take a photo of the window from the inside after the air sealing product has been applied into the area 
      between the new window and the rough opening.
    </PhotoInput>

    ## Completion Photos 
    <PhotoInput id="new_window_from_outside_photo" label="New Window from the Outside – Photo">
     Take a photo of the new window from the outside. This photo should show how the siding and trim
