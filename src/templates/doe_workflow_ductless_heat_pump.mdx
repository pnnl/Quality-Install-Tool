        ## Proposed Outdoor Unit
       
        Enter how the outdoor unit (ODU) will be installed and the location's average snow depth, the outdoor unit 
        should be installed above the snow depth. The customer may also have knowledge on how high the snow 
        typically gets at the planned heat pump location.


        <Collapsible header="About Ductless Heat Pumps">
            If a home has ductwork and a central HVAC system, effort should be made to improve and/or
            repair the ductwork and/or replace the ductwork with new ductwork. Ductless heat pumps
            should be considered an appliance to be used only when a ducted option isn’t possible or
            where adding ductwork would be extremely difficult and cost prohibitive.

        ## Manual J Calculation
        <Collapsible header="Manual J Calculation Details">
            Correctly sizing the heat pump for the home’s heating and cooling needs is much more
            important for a heat pump than for a furnace and AC system. Use ACCA-approved Manual J
            residential load calculation software. It is recommended that the Manual J calculations be
            performed with the home occupant present that knows the most about the home to help
            determine the most accurate values to enter. Ask the home occupant whether any rooms
            presently get too hot or cold.

        ## Equipment Selection
        <Collapsible header="Equipment Selection Details">
            Select the equipment based on the ASHRAE heating and cooling design conditions, Manual J load calculation or 
            alternate load sizing method, and the decided percent load which the heat pump will cover.
 
            These decisions depend on knowing the equipment’s performance at specific temperatures. Reference the manufacturer’s 
            extended performance tables and/or the NEEP Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pump List. Factor in auxiliary heat, 
            or dual fuel into the equipment selection as applicable. If the existing ducts can only accommodate a heat pump 
            below the size that is needed, discuss with the customer the option of upgrading the ducts versus supplementing 
            the central heat pump with one or more ductless heat pumps. Please add a comment recording the decisions made.

            # Ductless Heat Pump Upgrade
            ## Photo Report
        
           <ProjectInfoReport {...props} />

            ## About the Report
            This report is intended to document the critical tests and details spanning from the planning,
            sizing, and equipment selection step for a ductless heat pump to the completed installation.
            
            ## About Ductless Heat Pumps Used as Supplemental Heating/Cooling
            If a ductless heat pump will be used as supplemental heating and/or cooling in concert with a
            central system, be sure to not run the ductless heat pump in heating mode while the central
            system is in cooling mode or vice versa. Make sure every household member knows to check
            the mode of both the thermostat of the central system and the ductless heat pump remote
            when changing from heating to cooling or vice versa. The same applies to muti-split heat pumps
            (one outdoor unit serving multiple indoor units), make sure to not set one indoor unit to
            heating mode while the others are in cooling mode.
            
            ## Do not set Ductless Heat Pumps to Auto Mode
            Do not set ductless heat pumps to auto mode which will result in the equipment making
            frequent switches between heating mode and cooling mode resulting in large energy efficiency
            penalties and high energy bills.

            ## ATTENTION CUSTOMER: Ductless Heat Pump Cleaning and Maintenance
            ## Quarterly
            ### Air Filter
            Ductless heat pumps have mesh filters that need to be checked and cleaned quarterly. Refer to the owner’s 
            manual for details on how to do this on your specific unit. The mesh filters can be cleaned using a vacuum. 
            For stickier dust, wash them gently using soap and water.

            ## Twice a Year
            ### Outdoor Unit Condenser Coil
            It is a best practice to inspect the outdoor unit at least twice a year for debris build up on the 
            condenser coil. Leaves, pollen, and fluff from cottonwood trees can build up and block the movement of air 
            through the condenser coil and cause poor performance. You can carefully clean loose debris off the 
            condenser coil using a vacuum cleaner and a soft brush. Take care to not bend the fins on the condenser 
            coil. For more stubborn or stickier dust, it is best practice to call an HVAC service tech. 
            They will spray down your coil with the correct cleaning detergent to not damage the material and 
            disassemble the outdoor unit enough to spray water from the inside to push out the dust and debris and 
            rinse the coil free of the cleaning detergent.

            ## Yearly
            ### Deep Cleaning
            It is good practice to do a deep cleaning of the ductless heat pump indoor unit yearly. A deep 
            cleaning is not a DIY task, it is a call and have an HVAC service tech do it task. You can check to 
            see if a cleaning is needed by turning off the ductless heat pump, then gently pulling the louver open 
            and looking at the blower wheel. If there is a buildup of dust or mold on the blower wheel it is time for 
            a deep cleaning. The HVAC service tech will disassemble the ductless heat pump head to remove the blower 
            wheel to thoroughly clean it outside. When the ductless heat pump head is disassembled, they will also 
            clean the coil, condensate tray, and condensate drain. You can expect this deep cleaning procedure to 
            take several hours.

            ### Condensate Drain
            It is a best practice to inspect the end of the condensate drain yearly. If there is a buildup of 
            goo/slime/mucus/snot at the end of the condensate drain line, it is time to call a HVAC service tech.
             They will use the combination of a shop vac, drain snakes, and pressurized water to clean out the 
             condensate drain line.

                A quality flare is essential to a ductless heat pump that will not leak refrigerant during its lifetime. 
                One way to gauge the quality of a flare is to measure it in a flare gauge to ensure it is the correct size.
            </Photo>

            <Photo id="torque_wrench_setting_photo" label="Torque Wrench Setting – Photo" required>
               Over or under torquing a flare connection will greatly increase the chance of a refrigerant leak. 
               Thus, a torque wrench is needed to ensure the flare connections are torqued just right.
            </Photo>

            <Photo id="nitrogen_pressure_test_setup_photo" label="Nitrogen Pressure Test Setup – Photo" required>
                The test is conducted at 500 PSI or the manufacturer's recommended test pressure. 
            </Photo>

            <Photo id="pressure_test_result_photo" label="Nitrogen Pressure Test Results – Photo" required>
                A passing temperature-compensated nitrogen pressure decay test will show zero or almost zero pressure decay after 10 minutes. 
              This means the system's connections have been tested to withstand the maximum operating pressures and there are no leaks in the system. 
            </Photo>

            <Photo id="vacuum_setup_photo" label="Vacuum Setup – Photo" required>
                A good vacuum decay test setup will have the micron gauge located as close to the equipment as possible. It will have an isolation
                 valve in the setup so that the vacuum pump and vacuum hose can be isolated from the system during the decay measurement period. 
            </Photo>

            <Photo id="vacuum_decay_test_results_photo" label="Vacuum Decay Test Results – Photo" required>
                 A passing vacuum decay test is one where the system's vacuum does not rise above 500 microns in 10 minutes with the vacuum pump and 
                vacuum hose isolated from the system. This indicates the system contains no moisture and is leak free.

                The ODU comes factory charged with enough refrigerant for a line set out to a certain length. If the line set in the installation is longer than that, 
                then some additional refrigerant needs to be added. The installation manual contains the details on what they maximum line set length is 
                for the factory charge and how much refrigerant to add per additional foot of line set.
