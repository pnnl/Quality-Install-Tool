    Prior to air sealing and insulating the floor joists (ceiling of an unconditioned crawlspace/basement ceiling) above an 
    unconditioned space check the outside grade slope, gutter and downspout. Inside the unconditioned crawlspace/basement 
    check the condition of the wood framing, vapor barrier, foundation wall, drain system, water and sewer pipes, and 
    electrical wires. Look for dryer vents, exhaust fans, and combustion appliances venting into the unconditioned 
    space instead of outside. Look for signs of pest entry. If the home is in an area where high radon is common, 
    look for a radon mitigation system. If the home is in a seismic, hurricane, or tornado zone look for hold downs and 
    lateral bracing.  If there are ducts hanging below the elevation of the floor joists, they must be air sealed and 
    insulated prior to this work.

    ## General Safety
    <Collapsible header="General Safety">
        Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, 
        it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. Some common causes of mold or moisture issues in the crawlspace include: missing or leaking gutters or downspouts, inadequate or reversed grading around the home, or missing or poor condition vapor barrier.
    </Collapsible>

    <Collapsible header="Drainage condition"> 
    Check the grade around the home is sloped away from the house, check for standing water in the crawlspace or 
    basement floor, check the gutters and downspouts are in good condition.

    Contractors should perform this inspection prior to work as protection against being blamed for a pre-existing 
    mold or moisture problem. Air sealing and insulation can make a pre-existing mold or moisture problem worse, 
    thus it is important to check for the safety of the customer.

      Installing only batt insulation into the floor cavity is not best practice because that method doesn’t result in a vapor 
      barrier. The recommended three methods are shown in the heading figure, which all result in a vapor barrier. 
      The installation of rigid foam insulation that covers the floor joist, rigid foam covering the floor joist with batt 
      insulation inside the floor joist cavities, or close cell spray foam insulation that covers the floor joist tips are 
      all acceptable best practice methods for air sealing.
