    Prior to air sealing and insulating the floor joists (ceiling of an unconditioned crawlspace/basement ceiling) above an 
    unconditioned space check the outside grade slope, gutter and downspout. Inside the unconditioned crawlspace/basement 
    check the condition of the wood framing, vapor barrier, foundation wall, drain system, water and sewer pipes, and 
    electrical wires. Look for dryer vents, exhaust fans, and combustion appliances venting into the unconditioned 
    space instead of outside. Look for signs of pest entry. If the home is in an area where high radon is common, 
    look for a radon mitigation system. If the home is in a seismic, hurricane, or tornado zone look for hold downs and 
    lateral bracing.  If there are ducts hanging below the elevation of the floor joists, they must be air sealed and 
    insulated prior to this work.

    ## General Safety
    <Collapsible header="General Safety">
    Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, 
    it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. Some common causes of mold or moisture issues 
    include a leaky roof, leaky ducts and clogged gutter or drainage systems.
    </Collapsible>
    
    <Collapsible header="Roof condition">   
    Look for water stains, mold, and moss on the roof, drip edge, and soffits. Water from a roof that doesn’t make it into a 
    gutter can cause significant problem to the foundation. Air sealing and insulating a foundation reduces the drying rate 
    of building materials and the foundation environment thus it is important to reduce the water and moisture loading rate.
   </Collapsible>
    <Radio label="What is the roof condition?" options={['Good','Potential Issue']} path="floor_air_sealing_roof_condition" />

    <Collapsible header="Drainage condition"> 
    * Check the gutters and downspouts are in good condition. Look to see if the home has footing drains. If not, evaluate 
    whether the local climate conditions and property grade conditions warrant the installation of a footing/French drain.
    * Check the grade around the home to see if there is space to allow the grade to slope away from the house after 
    backfilling at the end of this project.
    * Check the grade of the foundation floor versus the outside grade and the slope of foundation drain pipes to see if a sump pump is needed.
    * Check rim joist area for wetness, rot, mold, or pest damage. These can be signs the siding material was installed without the proper flashing and backside drainage.

    Contractors should perform this inspection prior to work as protection against being blamed for a pre-existing mold or 
    moisture problem. Air sealing and insulation can make a pre-existing mold or moisture problem worse, thus it is important 
    to check for the safety of the customer.

  ## Combustion Appliance Safety Testing
  If the home upgrades will result in a barometric draft controlled or Category I appliances equipped with a draft 
  hood or connected to a natural draft venting system remaining in the conditioned envelope of the home, combustion 
  safety checks are required to be performed at the completion of the project. Please perform and document these
