    Prior to air sealing and insulating a foundation wall, look for signs of water damage, pest damage, missing or 
    inadequate lateral/shear bracing, missing or inadequate hold downs, and improper utility penetrations through 
    the foundation wall. Look for mold. Look for appliances that are venting into the crawlspace/basement and not 
    to outside. If these problems are found, please remediate them prior to air sealing and insulation. Check if 
    the home is in a location where high levels of radon is likely, if so, a radon test should be done prior to 
    air sealing and insulation work. Check the gutters and grade slope around the house and remediate issues 
    that would result in water flowing back towards the house. Lastly check the foundation floor. If it is a 
    slab look for significant cracks, if the floor is a vapor barrier look for any significant damage that 
    would warrant repair or replacement.

    ## General Safety
    <Collapsible header="General Safety">
        Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. Some common causes of mold or moisture issues include a leaky roof, leaky ducts and clogged gutter or drainage systems.
    </Collapsible>

    <Collapsible header="Roof condition">   
    * Look for water stains, mold, or signs of pest entry. Water and moisture issues from a leaky roof can be made worse once the attic has been air sealed and insulated because afterwards there is less heat escaping to dry the roof/attic.
    * Pest entry can rapidly damage air sealing and insulation materials thus it is important to check and remediate prior to work. 
    </Collapsible>
    <Radio label="What is the roof condition?" options={['Good','Potential Issue']} path="roof_condition" />

    <Collapsible header="Drainage condition"> 
    Check the grade around the home is sloped away from the house, check for standing water in the crawlspace or 
    basement floor, check the gutters and downspouts are in good condition. Once the attic has been air sealed and 
    insulated there is less heat escaping to dry the roof/attic thus water damage caused by clogged gutter will be 
    much worse. Once the attic has been air sealed and insulated the amount of air exfiltrating through the attic 
    is reduced and therefore the amount of air infiltrating into the crawlspace/basement is also reduced. 
    Thus, even though attic air sealing and insulation of the attic is being performed, it can reduce the drying 
    force of the crawlspace/basement, thus pre-existing moisture problems in the crawlspace/basement can be made 
    worse by this action. Thus, it is a good practice to check and document pre-existing problems.

    <Radio label="What is the drainage system condition?" options={['Good','Potential Issue']} path="drainage_condition" />

    <Collapsible header="Mold or Moisture in or Outside the Home"> 
    Contractors should perform this inspection prior to work as protection against being blamed for a pre-existing 
    mold or moisture problem. Air sealing and insulation can make a pre-existing mold or moisture problem worse, 
    thus it is important to check for the safety of the customer.
