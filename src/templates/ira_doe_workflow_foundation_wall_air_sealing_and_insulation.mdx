    Prior to air sealing and insulating a foundation wall, look for signs of water damage, pest damage, missing or
    inadequate lateral/shear bracing, missing or inadequate hold downs, and improper utility penetrations through
    the foundation wall. Look for mold. Look for appliances that are venting into the crawlspace/basement and not
    to outside. If these problems are found, please remediate them prior to air sealing and insulation. Check if
    the home is in a location where high levels of radon is likely, if so, a radon test should be done prior to
    air sealing and insulation work. Check the gutters and grade slope around the house and remediate issues
    that would result in water flowing back towards the house. Lastly check the foundation floor. If it is a
    slab look for significant cracks, if the floor is a vapor barrier look for any significant damage that
    would warrant repair or replacement.

        Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. Some common causes of mold or moisture issues include a leaky roof, leaky ducts and clogged gutter or drainage systems.
    </Collapsible>

    <Collapsible header="Drainage condition">
    Check the grade around the home is sloped away from the house, check for standing water in the crawlspace or

    Contractors should perform this inspection prior to work as protection against being blamed for a pre-existing

    thus it is important to check for the safety of the customer.
