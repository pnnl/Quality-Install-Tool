    The application of air permeable insulation without first air sealing is not an acceptable practice. 
    E.g. just blowing in insulation into the walls without first blocking off and air sealing open top 
    plates and bottom plate. Instead HEAR (50122) requires air sealing efforts to precede insulation work 
    unless the insulation is spray foam which functions both as an air sealing product an insulation. 
    The air sealing and insulation don’t have to be done by the same contractor. Prior to air sealing 
    and insulating the walls check for signs of water intrusion, mold, pests, unsafe electrical wiring, 
    polybutylene pipe, and exterior wall cavities used as a duct. Make necessary repairs prior to or at 
    the same time as air sealing and insulating the walls. Inspect the windows and doors, if they are due 
    for replacement, discuss with the customer the benefits of upgrading the windows and/or doors and then 
    doing the wall air sealing and insulation. It is strongly recommended to discuss with the customer whether, 
    electrical or HVAC upgrades, or remodeling work are in the near-term plans as these upgrades could damage 
    the wall air sealing and insulation.

    ## General Safety
    <Collapsible header="General Safety">
        Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. Some common causes of mold or moisture issues include a leaky roof, leaky ducts and clogged gutter or drainage systems.
    </Collapsible>

    <Collapsible header="Roof condition">   
    * Look for water stains, mold, or signs of pest entry. Water and moisture issues from a leaky roof can be made worse once the attic has been air sealed and insulated because afterwards there is less heat escaping to dry the roof/attic.
    * Pest entry can rapidly damage air sealing and insulation materials thus it is important to check and remediate prior to work. 
    </Collapsible>
    <Radio label="What is the roof condition?" options={['Good','Potential Issue']} path="roof_condition" />

    <Collapsible header="Drainage condition"> 
    Check the grade around the home is sloped away from the house, check for standing water in the crawlspace or 
    basement floor, check the gutters and downspouts are in good condition. Once the attic has been air sealed and 
    insulated there is less heat escaping to dry the roof/attic thus water damage caused by clogged gutter will be 
    much worse. Once the attic has been air sealed and insulated the amount of air exfiltrating through the attic 
    is reduced and therefore the amount of air infiltrating into the crawlspace/basement is also reduced. 
    Thus, even though attic air sealing and insulation of the attic is being performed, it can reduce the drying 
    force of the crawlspace/basement, thus pre-existing moisture problems in the crawlspace/basement can be made 
    worse by this action. Thus, it is a good practice to check and document pre-existing problems.

    <Collapsible header="Mold or Moisture in or Outside the Home"> 
    Contractors should perform this inspection prior to work as protection against being blamed for a pre-existing 
    mold or moisture problem. Air sealing and insulation can make a pre-existing mold or moisture problem worse, 
    thus it is important to check for the safety of the customer.

    ##  Air Sealing Details
    A blower door is recommended for finding were on walls to air seal and areas with missing interior air barrier. 
    Depending on the home and the condition of the siding material, it might be similar cost to air seal and 
    insulate the wall by adding exterior insulation when residing versus drilling and filling the walls with insulation.

       to access the rim/band joist to air seal results in significant air leakage reduction.
