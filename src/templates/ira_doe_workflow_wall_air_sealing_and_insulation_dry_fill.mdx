    The application of air permeable insulation without first air sealing is not an acceptable practice. 
    E.g. just blowing in insulation into the walls without first blocking off and air sealing open top 
    plates and bottom plate. Best practice requires air sealing efforts to precede insulation work 
    unless the insulation is spray foam which functions both as an air sealing product and insulation. 
    The air sealing and insulation don’t have to be done by the same contractor. Prior to air sealing 
    and insulating the walls check for signs of water intrusion, mold, pests, unsafe electrical wiring, 
    polybutylene pipe, and exterior wall cavities used as a duct. Make necessary repairs prior to or at 
    the same time as air sealing and insulating the walls. Inspect the windows and doors, if they are due 
    for replacement, discuss with the customer the benefits of upgrading the windows and/or doors and then 
    doing the wall air sealing and insulation. It is strongly recommended to discuss with the customer whether, 
    electrical or HVAC upgrades, or remodeling work are in the near-term plans as these upgrades could damage 
    the wall air sealing and insulation.

    <Collapsible header="General Safety">
        Some homes have existing mold or moisture issues. For the contractor’s protection and the safety of the customer, it is important to inspect for pre-existing mold or moisture issues. 
        Some common causes of mold or moisture issues in walls include roofs missing kick out flashings and/or step flashings and windows missing metal head flashings.

    thus it is important to check for the safety of the customer.

    ##  Air Sealing Details
    A blower door is recommended for finding were on walls to air seal and areas with missing interior air barrier. 
    Depending on the home and the condition of the siding material, it might be similar cost to air seal and 
    insulate the wall by adding exterior insulation when residing versus drilling and filling the walls with insulation.

    <PhotoInput id="electrical_outlets_and_switches_photo" label="Electrical outlets and switches air sealed – Photo" >
     * Air seal the box-to-drywall connection
     * Air seal the wire penetrations.
     * Provide one representative photo.
    </PhotoInput> 

    <PhotoInput id="windows_and_door_air_sealed_photo" label="Windows and door air sealed – Photo" >
    *	Air seal the trim to the drywall.
    *	Air seal the window/door frame to the trim.
    *	Remember to caulk the top seams also. 
    *	Provide one representative photo.
    </PhotoInput> 

    <PhotoInput id="rim_joist_air_sealed_photo" label="Rim/band joist between floors air sealed – Photo" >
       * If the budget allows and the customer is willing, cutting a strip of drywall out of the ceiling between floor 
       to access the rim/band joist to air seal results in significant air leakage reduction.
       * Insulation should be blown into air permeable bags to keep the insulation at the correct density and 
       against the rim/band joist cavity. 
    </PhotoInput> 

    <PhotoInput id="tub_shower_exterior_wall_photo" label="Tub/Shower on exterior wall – Photo " >
      * Use a borescope camera to see if there is an interior air barrier for tub/shower installed against 
          an exterior wall. Take a picture of the camera’s screen. If there is an air barrier, good. 
      * If not, when drilling and filling the walls with insulation, the tub/shower wall becomes the wall 
          and interior air barrier.
      </PhotoInput> 

    <PhotoInput id="prefabricated_metal_fireplace_exterior_wall_photo" label="Prefabricated metal fireplaces on exterior wall – Photo" >
      Prefabricated metal fireplaces are often installed into niche framed into an exterior wall. 
      Unfortunately, many of these fireplace niches are poorly sealed against air leaks. Sometimes they 
      even lack an interior air barrier.  Use a borescope camera and/or a thermal imaging camera to see the 
      interior air barrier and air sealing quality around the fireplace. Take a picture of the camera’s screen. 
      If the fireplace has been removed to install air sealing and/or air barrier material, take a picture of the finished work.
    </PhotoInput> 

    <PhotoInput id="chase_wall_photo" label="Chase wall – Photo" >
    * Chase walls for chimneys intersecting with an exterior wall may lack an interior air barrier. 
    To check, use a borescope camera to see if there is an interior air barrier. Take a picture of the camera’s screen. 
    If there is an air barrier, good. 
    * If not, discuss with the customer. If the budget allows and the customer is willing, 
    cut a strip of drywall out of the chase wall to install an interior air barrier and air seal it. An alternative is 
    to remove a section of siding and sheathing to install the interior air barrier from the outside.
    </PhotoInput> 

    <PhotoInput id="soffit_against_exterior_wall_photo" label="Soffit against exterior wall – Photo" >
    * Soffits are commonly used to house recessed lights or ventilation ducts. When they abut an exterior wall, 
    the exterior wall often lacks an interior air barrier. To check, use a borescope camera to see if there is an 
    interior air barrier. Take a picture of the camera’s screen. If there is an air barrier, good. 
    * If not, discuss with the customer. If the budget allows and the customer is willing, cut a strip of drywall out of the soffit 
     to install an interior air barrier and air seal it. An alternative is to remove a section of siding and
