      The presence of knob and tube wiring, cloth insulated wiring, or ungrounded electrical 
      systems (two prong receptacles) are often reasons to upgrade the wiring in a home. 
      Electrical wiring upgrades should be done prior to air sealing and insulation. 
      Many new holes will be drilled into top plates and/or bottom plates to fish the new wires 
      to electrical outlet and switches. Some drywall will need to be cut to gain access 
      to pull the new wires to electrical outlet and switches.

    ## Installation
    A project that involves replacing old electrical wiring will also include the installation 
    of a new circuit breaker panel as well as upgrading/adding circuits to power new electrical 
    appliance and to future proof the home such as adding wires for an electric heat pump water 
    heater, heat pump, whole house mechanical ventilation, induction cooktop/range, electric 
    heat pump clothes dryer, solar PV + batteries, and a Level 2 electric vehicle charger even 
    if the home currently doesn’t have these electrical appliances.
